      <p>Oh Herro! Here's a little bit about myself, I like to try all kinds of food places and coffee/tea spots. All about those pick me ups, "Coffee/Bang!/Amino Energy!".  Always gotta work early and commute hours and hours to work and back that caffeine really helps due to lack of sleep. The funny thing is that when I took the picture to the left I was so tired that even though my eyes don't look so open, I was straining my eyes to get them open to that point lol.
      <br> I love listening to music because, depending on how I'm feeling and what I'm listening to, I can hype myself up to do a task or calm myself down. I grew up listening to oldies and hip hop/rap. These past couple of years, I've been listening to a lot of Christian rap because of the positive content. Some artists I've been listening to lately are Trip Lee and Propaganda. Also, tracks that have beats that make me want to dance are so dope.
      <br>
      I've been in construction for 12 years with U.A. Local 483. From 07' up until I joined this bootcamp, it was all about that construction life. I'm excited to see the end result of learning how to code!
